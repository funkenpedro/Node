//using references (normalization)  -> Consistency, single place to modify but requires multiple querys to load author from course
let author={
name:'Pedro'
}
let course = {
author:'id',               //this doesn't have to relate to author object in mongodb
//authors:['id1', id2]
}
//using embedded documents --> Performance, only one query, but changing author has to be done for every course

let course={
author:{name:Mosh}
}

//Hybrid Approach

let author ={name:mosh,//50 other properties}

let course=author{ //this gives you quick access because it is a reference to the single storage of the other object
id:'ref',
name:'Mosh'
}
