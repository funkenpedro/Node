examples of global objects are:
console

setTimeout
clearTimeout
setInterval
clearInterval

window is usually the global scope in javascript
declared variables become part of the global object

In node the global scope is called global instead of window
declared variables do not become part of global object
THEY CAN ONLY BE ACCESSSED IN  THEIR FILE

Modules are used to share objects between files
files are considered modules
try console.log(module) - it returns the file's properties

the methods in a module are private
you can make it public with 

module.exports.

modules are always wrapped in a function:

function(exports, requier, module, __filename, __dirname){}
this expression is invisible, you can access any of these properties

Useful built in modules
go to nodejs.org - docs to read up on them

Important built in modules:
Path 
OS
the require statement requires no path so:
const os = require('os')  
fs  - filesystem -- avoid using synchronous methods

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
events
http is a node class
to build a webserver, listen to a port
the object raises events when it ges a request

Node Documentation:
Class EventEmitter

in vscode:
const EventEmitter = require('events')
const emitter = new EventEmitter();

emitter.emit('messageLogged', {argument object})
//register a listener
emitter.on (' messageLogged', callback)   //.on is an alias for .addListener



callback(args){}
